<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Setting up your environment for the first time can be a daunting task. Still, after you&#39;re done, you get the feeling you learned something important. This will be your new playground, a place for your code to become alive. Take your

time, and try to understand the process. There will be links provided so you can read more about it, if you choose to...</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows: &nbsp;Setting up your local <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server" target="_blank">web server</a> on a Windows machine can be accomplished with a little more ease using either

Bitnami&#39;s <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp" target="_blank">WAMP</a> or <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a> stacks. &nbsp;We will be using XAMPP for this tutorial.</p>

<ol>

<li>&nbsp; &nbsp;Goto <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">this XAMPP download page</a> and click on the <u style="font-weight: bold;">XAMPP for Windows</u> installation, which should automatically start downloading the .EXE

for you. ( Note: I assume you are running on a fairly recent machine. This tutorial is showing how to inststall on <strong>Windows 10,&nbsp;</strong>but I am sure it will work for windows 7 &amp; 8 as well...&nbsp;).</li>

<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Click the finished download icon when it is finished. You will see a small window appear with a security warning. Click <strong>Run.&nbsp;</strong>Another warning will appear, click okay and proceed to next step.</li>

<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; This page displays all the options you can install. This tutorial is trying to get you set up for localhost with Apache, but you can install any of the options now and google how to use them if you want. &nbsp;Make sure <strong>Apache</strong>,

<strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Webalizer</strong>, and<strong>&nbsp;phpMyAdmin</strong> are checked. Then click next.</li>

<li>This step is where you install everything. You want to install from the Root. it should be <a href="C%3A%5Cxampp">C:\xampp</a></li>

<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; During install, you will receive a Security Alert for the services to communicate with Firewall. Click <strong>Allow Access&nbsp;</strong>to continue, and the next screen will prompt you to click <strong>Finish&nbsp;</strong>to start up

XAMPP and the control panel.&nbsp;</li>

</ol>
