Hello everyone! i would like to get right into producing content that is meant for this site, but i thought a quick post on resources was in order! Now I cannot give you all the perfect places to go out and grab information because you will learn on this journey that it can sometimes add up to preference. This means that, as you determine what language you decide to prefer, and dive deeper into becoming a kick ass engineer, you will follow bloggers, youtuber's, and other people that bend towards your style. That being said, I would like to introduce you to some of my favorite sites that can get you answers. These sites got me through a whole bunch, and i still use/refer to them today. So save them, write them down, and force yourself to visit them regularly! When you feel the urge to check out that latest tweet, or bullshit video that probably won't even put a smile on your face, review these instead. 



W3Schools(W3S): This is it. You decided to learn. As you progress, W3schools will be right there to answer all your questions, examples included.



Mozilla Developer(MOZ): This is the de-facto for front-end developing. I would put this as #1, and as you get comfortable, you will understand why. Either way, this is the gold standard for resource/reference.



codepen.io: T_U will show a lot of playgrounds to craft your skills, but Chris Coyier (creator) and his team give devs a place to receive instant results for any idea that might be going on in your mind. 



CSS-Tricks: Don't forget the '-', from the same brilliant mind of codepen, then community driven site can be a great resource for a lot of issues you might be stuck on. Also brought the dev world an "official" Flexbox reference page!



Free Code Camp (FCC): Are you sick of trying to piece it all together, and don't feel ready to shell out cash for commitment yet? FCC will take you from beginning to end, filled with challenges, a huge welcoming community, and a built-in editor, you can become dangerous real fast if you are determined!



Where's the rest? Good question. When I started, I was overwhelmed with information, and I want you to get started. These links will take the guessing out, and get you zooming in the a direction. If you decide that a front-end development career is not what interests you, T_U will have a similar post later on to get you on track. For now, have some faith, and start browsing! Why are you still reading?!?!?  Ha, seriously though, sign up for these sites, and start soaking up the concept. Then continue reading Tech_Uncensored posts to get started on your future. Remember, you can do this. If you get stuck or confused, PLEASE write us! We will UN-STICK (?) you.
